**Objectives:**
The aim of this study is to the comparative effectiveness and safety of all emerging drug therapies used in COVID-19 treatment.

Specifically, the study has the following objectives:

1) To assess comparative effectiveness and safety among treatments administered during hospitalization and prior to intensive services, and
2) To assess comparative effectiveness and safety among treatments administered after COVID-19 positive testing or diagnosis in outpatient setting without prior hospitalization
